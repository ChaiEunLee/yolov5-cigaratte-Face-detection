==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on November 18, 2021 at 6:39 PM GMT

It includes 4023 images.
Cigarette are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
